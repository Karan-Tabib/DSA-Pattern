     * Time Complexity:
     * 
     * Time Complexcity is not equal to time taken
     *
     * Time Complexity : its fuction that gives us relationship about how the time 
     *     will grow as the input grows.
     *
     * what do we consider when thinking about complexity?
     * 
     *  Always look for worst case complexity.
     *  Always look at complexity for large /infine data
     *  Always ingore constants.
     *  Always ignore less dominatig term.
     *  Ex: what will have when 2 users using your app and million users using app
     *  
     *  O(1) < O(log(n) < O(2^n)
     *  
     *  Big -O notation :
     *      O(n)
     *  
     *  
     *  Space Complexity:
     *  space complexity of recursive algo is hieght of tree that is O(n)
     *  
     *  there are two types of recursion
     *      1 linear
     *      2. divide and conquar
